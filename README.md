## Installation Methods

### Option 1: Unraid (Recommended for Unraid Users)

For Unraid users, you can install this as a Docker container using the provided template:

1. **Download the Unraid template**: [emby-newsletter.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J0n4e/emby-newsletter/main/assets/emby-newsletter.xml)
2. **Install the template**:
   - Save the template file to `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/` on your Unraid server
   - Go to **Docker** tab in Unraid
   - Click **Add Container** 
   - The template will appear in your local templates list
3. **Configure your settings** in the template fields
4. **Click Apply** to install and start the container

The Unraid template includes:
- Pre-configured security settings with read-only filesystem
- Built-in cron support with proper permissions
- Easy timezone and scheduling configuration
- Optional pre-filling of API keys and settings
- Secure tmpfs mounts for optimal performance

### Option 2: Docker Compose (Recommended for other systems)

This is the default and recommended way to run the newsletter. The Docker container will run on a schedule using a built-in cron job.

1. Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J0n4e/emby-newsletter/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml) file:
   ```bash
   curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J0n4e/emby-newsletter/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. (optional) Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to change the default user or timezone.

3. Create a `config` folder in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```bash
   mkdir config
   ```

4. Download the [config file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J0n4e/emby-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml) in the `config` folder:
   ```bash
   curl -o config/config.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J0n4e/emby-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml
   ```

5. Edit the `config/config.yml` file and fill in the required fields. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section below for details.

6. Run the docker container with docker compose
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

> **Note:** It is recommended to use a static version instead of `latest`, and manually upgrade. [Last version](https://github.com/J0n4e/emby-newsletter/releases)

### Alternative: Docker without cron

Use this method if you want to run the script on a schedule using an external cron job or task scheduler, instead of the built-in cron job. Docker will run once, and exit after sending the newsletter.

1. Create a `config` folder.
   ```bash
   mkdir config
   ```

2. Download the [config file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J0n4e/emby-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml) in the `config` folder:
   ```bash
   curl -o config/config.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J0n4e/emby-newsletter/refs/heads/main/config/config-example.yml
   ```

3. Edit the `config/config.yml` file and fill in the required fields. **Important:** Comment out the `scheduler` section to disable built-in cron:
   ```yaml
   #scheduler:
     # Comment this section to disable built-in scheduling
     #cron: "0 8 1 * *"
   ```

4. Run the docker container to send the newsletter
   ```bash
   docker run --rm \
     -v ./config:/app/config \
     ghcr.io/j0n4e/emby-newsletter:latest
   ```

> **Note:** It is recommended to use a static version instead of `latest`, and manually upgrade. [Last version](https://github.com/J0n4e/emby-newsletter/releases)

5. Schedule the script to run on a regular basis.
   ```bash
   # Unix :
   crontab -e
   # Add the following line to run the script every 1st of the month at 8am
   0 8 1 * * root docker run --rm -v PATH_TO_CONFIG_FOLDER/config:/app/config/ ghcr.io/j0n4e/emby-newsletter:latest
   ```

## Security Features

This newsletter application is built with security in mind:

- **Read-only filesystem** - Container runs with read-only root filesystem
- **Secure tmpfs mounts** - Temporary files use memory-based storage with security restrictions  
- **No privilege escalation** - Container runs with `no-new-privileges:true`
- **Input sanitization** - All user data is properly escaped and validated
- **XSS protection** - Multiple layers of protection against cross-site scripting
- **Security scanning** - Code is regularly scanned with Semgrep for vulnerabilities

## Current limitations

- Email template language is currently set to English
- Only supports TLS for the SMTP server
- Only supports movies and TV shows for now
- Not available as an Emby plugin yet
- Must be run manually or scheduled
