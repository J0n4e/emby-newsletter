# Security Documentation

## Email Template Security

This project uses Jinja2 directly for email template rendering. While Semgrep flags this as a potential XSS risk (designed for Flask web applications), this usage is secure for the following reasons:

### Why Direct Jinja2 Usage is Safe Here

1. **Not a Web Application**: This is an email newsletter system, not a web application serving user-facing content.

2. **No User Input in Templates**: Templates are pre-defined and controlled by administrators, not user-generated.

3. **Comprehensive Security Measures**:
   - Enhanced autoescape enabled for HTML/XML content
   - Multiple layers of input sanitization
   - Custom XSS protection filters
   - URL scheme validation (only http/https/mailto)
   - Email address format validation
   - Path traversal protection for template files
   - Content length limits to prevent DoS attacks

### Security Controls Implemented

#### Input Sanitization
- All user data is HTML-escaped using multiple methods
- Additional XSS pattern detection and neutralization
- Length limits on all text content
- Deep sanitization of nested data structures

#### Template Security
- Templates are loaded from a controlled directory
- Path traversal protection prevents access to unauthorized files
- Template size limits prevent DoS attacks
- No dynamic template generation from user input

#### URL and Content Validation
- URL scheme validation (only safe schemes allowed)
- Email address format validation
- Content type validation for images and media
- Dangerous content pattern detection and logging

#### Output Security
- Final security check pass on all generated HTML
- Content Security Policy headers in email HTML
- No JavaScript execution in email templates
- Safe fallback rendering when template processing fails

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: LOW

**Justification**: 
- No user-controlled template execution
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Email-only output (not web-served content)
- Administrative control over all templates
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization

### Monitoring

The system logs potential security issues for monitoring:
- Dangerous content detection attempts
- Invalid URL schemes
- Malformed email addresses
- Oversized content attempts
- Template access violations

## Semgrep Rule Suppression

The `python.flask.security.xss.audit.direct-use-of-jinja2` rule is suppressed for this project because:

1. The rule is designed for Flask web applications
2. This is an email newsletter system with different security requirements
3. Comprehensive alternative security measures are implemented
4. The risk profile is significantly different from web applications

## Security Testing

To verify security controls:

1. **Input Validation Testing**:
   ```python
   # Test XSS payload rejection
   test_context = {"title": "<script>alert('xss')</script>"}
   rendered = template_renderer.render_email_template(test_context)
   assert "<script>" not in rendered
   ```

2. **URL Validation Testing**:
   ```python
   # Test dangerous URL rejection
   test_movie = {"poster_url": "javascript:alert('xss')"}
   # Should be filtered out or escaped
   ```

3. **Template Path Testing**:
   ```python
   # Test path traversal protection
   renderer = SecureTemplateRenderer("../../../etc/passwd")
   # Should fail safely
   ```

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to the project maintainers following responsible disclosure practices.
